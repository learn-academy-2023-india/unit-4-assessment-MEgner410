# UNIT 4: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. Compare and contrast JavaScript and Ruby. What are three things they have in common and what are three differences?

Similarities

1.they both auotmaticly manage memory by getting ride of the objects that are not in use anymore.

2.they both run with a OOP (object oriented prograhaming) language. with multuple priniples being supported.

3.because you dont have to specify the data type of a variable, it is determind during runtime cause they both use dynamic typing.

Differences

1. Ruby is often used for sever-side scripting, while JavaScript is prmarly used for client-side scripting in web browsers.

2.JavaScript has C-style syntex with curly braces, while Ruby has a more natural langusge-like syntex

3. Ruby has block-level scope while, JavaScript has function-level scope.

Researched answer: JavaScript and Ruby have commonalities such as automatic memory managment , a strong embrace of Object Oriented Programming (OOP), and a dynamic typing. both languages are flexiable and dynamically determine variables types during runtime.

However they differ in their execution enviorments. Javascript dominates client-side scripting for web browsers while Ruby shines in server side scripting and backwards



2. What does it mean to implement a TDD workflow?

Your answer: you plan what your code should do, write a test for it, and then write the actual code to make the test pass. it helps to ensure your code works as exspected. 

Researched answer: when implementeing a TDD workflow means following a development proccess where test are written before actual code implementations kind of like having a recipe you are following to make sure the dish turns out ok

3. What is a block in Ruby?

Your answer: are often used within methods to perform actions on a collection of items, like an array or a list they use do...end or {}

Researched answer: Block in ruby is a piece of code enclosed with curly braces '{}' is not a object itself but can be passed to methods. Blocks are communally used with inerators and methods that accept them, they provode a way to encapsulate behavior and passes it around in the code.

4. STRETCH: What is a version manager?

Answer: A version manger is a tool used to manage diffrent versions of programming languages runtime or libraries on a developers machanie. It allows develpoers to switch betweem particular projects.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Unit

Research and define the following terms.

1. Database migrations: Database migrations are a way to version control a database schema, allowing developers to make changes to the database structure over time. Migritations provide a systematic and reversiable way to apply changes, such as creating tables or modifying colums

2. Model validations: Model validations are rules defined within the model of an application to ensure that the data meets specific criteria before being saved to the database they also help maintain data integerity and consistency

3. Params: Params (shot for parameters) refer to the parameters or inputs passed to a controller action in a web application.
